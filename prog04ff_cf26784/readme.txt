Run in conjunction with a .txt file with characters used to represent colors, this program "flood fills" a user-entered
color based on user inputs specifying a specific row and column in the array of characters. It outputs the new picture
after the new color has been filled.

There are 4 files that make up this project:
 flood_fill_driver: main driver that prompts the user, receives user inputs, and implements the fill functions.
 flood_fill.c: Consists of 3 functions named loadPicture, displayPicture, and floodFill.
 makefile
 grid.txt: text file that contains the "picture" composed of characters

 Running the Program:
 1. Unzip the file prog04ff_cf26784.zip
 2. Compile and run on Linux
